# Data Scientist
## Using Data Science & Machine Learning to solve problems
Will a customer buy from us again? What items would a customer also be willing to buy if he bought item A? How much of item B will we sell in the following months? These are some question that might keep you awake. I am interested in helping companies to use their data to solve these and other real problems.

I am open-minded with good communication and good business vision. All decisions are customer and business centric, creating value for the stakeholders.
